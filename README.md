This is a basic client to demonstrate the functionality of the NCTS terminology syndication service.
It was developed during the third NCTS connectathon, hosted by the Australian Digital Health Agency on July 5+6 2016.

Unfortuneately I didn't get to demonstrate it to to very litteral last moment technical issues... But the application functions as intended.
possible improvements (if touched again :) ):
* implement Full text index ranking (and cusomtised).
* authentication of content downloads. (highly likely at future connectathon).

The current code relies on being seeded with a "FULL" SNOMED CT release for initialising (see code).
The syndication feed referenced is not currently publicly accessible.

There's certainly room for improvement in the quality of the code too. But this is a disposeable proof of concept project.
